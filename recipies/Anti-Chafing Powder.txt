Anti-Chafing Powder

Rub through a sieve about 3 tablespoons of dried rose petals, and about
1 1/2 to 2 Tbsp of dried lavender blossom-- try not to let lavender
overpower the mix. Add a pinch of finely ground cloves, myrrh, and benzoin
(unless the recipient is allergic to any of these). Also, we added several 
pinches of ground rosemary and thyme. Put through the sieve again. Mix
with 2-4 cups of cornstarch and adjust proportions for a good smelling
powder lightly flecked with botanicals. If the person is not allergic to
orris you can add a pinch of it for the fleeting but distinctive scent of
orris. 

You could also use rice flour instead of cornstarch for this, thus using
all period ingredients.
